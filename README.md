# AYURON ‚Äî ML-Based COPD Detection & Holistic Respiratory Care  

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains a major global health concern, particularly in low-resource and rural areas where conventional diagnostic tools are costly and inaccessible.  

**AYURON** presents a **non-invasive, mobile-friendly tool** for early screening of COPD. It uses **voice and cough recordings** captured via smartphones, converts them into **spectrograms**, and applies **machine learning** to identify sound patterns linked to COPD. The goal is to make early detection easier and more accessible, especially in rural and underserved areas.  

Beyond detection, the framework incorporates **Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)** to offer **holistic care** for respiratory health. It integrates:  
- **Aushadhi**: Ayurvedic herbal remedies  
- **Pranayama**: Yogic breathing techniques  
- **Swasthavritta**: Lifestyle and hygiene practices  
- **Prakriti Analysis**: Personalized care based on an individual‚Äôs constitution

## üéØ Primary Objectives  
- Develop an accurate ML-based system to detect COPD from **voice and cough audio inputs** recorded on mobile phones.  
- Enable **precise classification** of COPD severity stages using spectrogram analysis and advanced ML.  
- Integrate **personalized Ayurvedic remedy suggestions** in collaboration with qualified doctors.  
- Support **holistic patient care** and symptom management through IKS practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology  
1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Collect cough and voice recordings via mobile microphones.  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Noise reduction, normalization, and conversion into spectrograms.  
3. **Feature Extraction & Modeling**  
   - Use CNN-friendly spectrograms and handcrafted features (MFCCs, spectral features).  
   - Train and evaluate deep learning models for COPD detection and severity staging.  
4. **Integration with Holistic Care**  
   - Provide tailored Ayurvedic remedies and lifestyle practices through digital platforms.

## üîÆ Future Scope  
- Expansion to other respiratory diseases (Asthma, Bronchitis, Pneumonia).  
- Integration with **telemedicine platforms** and community health programs.  
- Real-time monitoring via **wearables and IoT devices**.  
- Clinical validation for regulatory approvals.
